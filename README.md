# Space Invaders Video Game
Final JavaScript project for BVT Module 2 (Intro to JavaScript)

### Description: 
* 2D Space Invaders game web app built in JavaScript, HTML and CSS with Bootstrap framework. I chose JS/HTML/CSS toolkit due to the clarity and ease of creating dynamic, interactable, well-structured and styled web apps in these languages, and due to their popularity. I Used VS Code for code editing and Git for version control since I am most familiar with these tools for software editing and control.
* This is a frontend application that saves game score data to web browser's local storage with its high score saving feature built using Web Storage API.
* Canvas API was utilized to render 2D shapes and animations, and to achieve interaction between graphical objects in the game.
* Space Invaders is a single player game, where player needs to pass all levels (stages), with different enemies at each stage which the player needs to destroy to win. If the player loses all its lives, the game is over. Score is based on the number of enemies and dangerous objects (asteroids) destroyed before the game is won. There are 2 Boss enemies throughout the gameplay, and with each new stage enemies become harder to defeat.
* Incorporates 12 video game stages, main menu user interface, options for sound effects and design customization, help page, custom difficulty settings with 3 difficulty levels, and high score saving.
