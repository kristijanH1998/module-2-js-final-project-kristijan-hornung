### Description: 
* 2D Space Invaders game web app built in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This is a frontend application that saves game progress data to web browser's local storage. 
* Space Invaders is a single player game, where player needs to pass all levels (stages), with different enemies at each stage which the player needs to destroy to win. If the player loses all its lives, the game is over. Score is based on the number of enemies and dangerous objects (asteroids) destroyed before the game is won. There are two Boss enemies throughout the gameplay, and with each new stage enemies become harder to defeat.
